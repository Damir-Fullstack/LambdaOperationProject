            <p>The λ-operation is a mathematical function performed over a matrix system. It combines the sum of all column means and the overall system mean to produce a unique numerical result.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>Working with Negative Numbers</h2>
        <p>In this system, calculations for negative ranges do not start from zero. To maintain the mathematical integrity of the matrix, the count begins at -1. This prevents rows from being nullified and preserves the structure of the operation.</p>

        <h2>The Rule of Symmetry</h2>
        <p>A key discovery in this operation is its non-commutative nature. The order of operands A and B is critical. For example, the result for λ(10, 6) is different from λ(6, 10). This asymmetry proves that each variable plays a distinct role in the matrix construction.</p>

        <h2>Universal Scale and Decimals</h2>
        <p>The operation is not limited to integers. It supports fractional values (e.g., 1.5) by creating a proportional scaling of the columns. This allows the λ-function to exist as a continuous mathematical model.</p>
